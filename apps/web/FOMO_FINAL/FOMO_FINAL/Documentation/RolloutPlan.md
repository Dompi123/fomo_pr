- **Current Phase**: Canary Release (5%)
- **Health Status**: Monitoring

## Initial Metrics Snapshot
```
{
    "error_rate": 0.0005,     // 0.05%
    "p95_latency": 150,       // 150ms
    "success_rate": 0.998,    // 99.8%
    "active_users": 127,      // Canary group
    "backend_health": "operational"
}
```

## Phase 1: Canary Release (Day 1)
- Deploy to 5% of users
- Monitor key metrics:
  - Error rates (target < 0.1%)
  - Response times (p95 < 200ms)
  - Rate limit hits
  - Authentication failures
  - PCI compliance alerts

### Success Criteria
- Error rate below 0.1%
- No PCI compliance violations
- Response times within baseline
- No critical security alerts

## Phase 2: Expanded Release (Day 2)
- Increase to 20% of users if Phase 1 criteria met
- Continue monitoring metrics
- Review user feedback and bug reports
- Monitor backend load and scaling

### Success Criteria
- Stable error rates
- No performance degradation
- No security incidents
- Positive user feedback

## Phase 3: Full Rollout (Day 3)
- Deploy to all users
- Maintain heightened monitoring
- Ready rollback plan if needed

### Success Criteria
- All metrics within acceptable ranges
- No significant issues for 24 hours
- Backend systems stable

## Monitoring Dashboard
```
METRICS_BASELINE = {
    "error_rate": 0.001,  # 0.1%
    "p95_latency": 200,   # 200ms
    "success_rate": 0.99  # 99%
}
```

## Rollback Plan
1. Trigger immediate rollback if:
   - Error rate exceeds 1%
   - Multiple PCI compliance alerts
   - Critical security vulnerability detected
   
2. Rollback Process:
   - Revert to last known good deployment
   - Switch traffic back to previous version
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Begin incident review

## Communication Plan
- Status updates every 4 hours during rollout
- Immediate notification for any critical issues
- Daily summary reports during phased rollout
- Final deployment report after full rollout

## Support Readiness
- Support team briefed on new features
- Monitoring team on high alert
- Security team available for rapid response
- Backend team on standby for issues

## Success Metrics
- API response times < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Error rates < 0.1%
- Zero PCI compliance violations
- Zero security incidents
- User satisfaction > 90%
