# Test Migration Checklist

Use this checklist to track progress on the test suite migration.

## Preparation

- [x] Create a new test directory structure
- [x] Update Jest configuration
- [x] Create `.env.test` file
- [x] Create test environment helpers
- [x] Update Jest setup and teardown scripts
- [x] Create migration scripts

## Example Tests

- [x] Authentication integration test
- [x] Payment processing integration test
- [x] User model unit test
- [x] Venue management integration test
- [ ] End-to-end test sample
- [ ] Performance test sample

## Test Migration

- [ ] Migrate `auth.test.cjs` to `unit/services/Auth.test.cjs`
- [ ] Migrate `payments.test.cjs` to `unit/services/Payments.test.cjs`
- [ ] Migrate `paymentRoutes.test.cjs` to `integration/payment/PaymentRoutes.test.cjs`
- [ ] Migrate `phase3Integration.test.cjs` to `integration/venue/VenueIntegration.test.cjs`
- [ ] Migrate `websocket.test.cjs` to `integration/venue/Websocket.test.cjs`
- [ ] Review and decide on `serviceContainer.test.cjs`
- [ ] Review and decide on `circuitBreaker.test.cjs`
- [ ] Review and decide on any other remaining tests

## Configuration Updates

- [ ] Update package.json scripts
- [ ] Update test run commands
- [ ] Configure coverage reporting
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline if applicable

## Documentation

- [x] Create README.md for tests
- [x] Document test organization
- [ ] Document test writing guidelines
- [ ] Document test run process

## Validation

- [ ] Run unit tests
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Run end-to-end tests
- [ ] Run performance tests
- [ ] Verify coverage reports

## Finalization

- [ ] Move any remaining old tests to legacy directory
- [ ] Final backup of old test structure
- [ ] Remove unnecessary backups
- [ ] Team announcement and training

## Notes

Use this section to track important decisions and observations during the migration process:

- The test directory structure now clearly separates different test types for better organization
- Unit tests focus on isolated functionality while integration tests verify cross-component behavior
- All tests now use a dedicated `.env.test` configuration
- The test database is isolated from the development and production databases
- Each test can be run individually or as part of a group
