# FOMO_PR Integration Guide

This guide will help you integrate the TypesTestView into your app and fix any remaining build issues.

## Step 1: Add the TypesTestView to Your App

You can add the TypesTestView to your app in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Add it to your TabView

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            // Your existing tabs
            
            TypesTestEntry()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Types Test", systemImage: "checkmark.circle")
                }
        }
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Add it to your navigation

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct YourView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                // Your existing list items
                
                NavigationLink(destination: TypesTestView()) {
                    Text("Test Types Availability")
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Your Title")
        }
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Use the convenience function

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        addTypesTestToApp()
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Update Your Import Statements

In files that were previously importing from Models, Network, or Core modules, you should now import from FOMO_PR:

```swift
// Change this:
import Models
import Network
import Core

// To this:
import FOMO_PR
```

We've provided a script `update_imports.sh` that automatically updates these imports in your project files. You can run it from the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x update_imports.sh
./update_imports.sh
```

## Step 3: Build and Run Your App

After adding the TypesTestView to your app and updating your import statements, build and run your app to see if the issues are resolved.

If you're still seeing errors, check the specific error messages and make sure the corresponding types are defined in `FOMOTypes.swift`.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Clean Your Build Folder

In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder to clear any cached build artifacts.

### 2. Check for Specific Error Messages

Look at the specific error messages and make sure the corresponding types are defined in `FOMOTypes.swift`. If you're seeing errors about missing types, you may need to add them to `FOMOTypes.swift`.

### 3. Update Your Import Statements

Make sure all files that need types from Models, Network, or Core are now importing from FOMO_PR.

### 4. Check for Conditional Compilation

Make sure any code that uses `#if SWIFT_PACKAGE` is properly handled. The `FOMOTypes.swift` file uses `#if !SWIFT_PACKAGE` to ensure that the types are only defined when not using Swift Package Manager.

### 5. Add Missing Types

If you're seeing errors about missing types, you may need to add them to `FOMOTypes.swift`. Follow the same pattern as the existing types.

## Key Files

- **FOMOTypes.swift**: Contains all the type definitions needed for your app
- **FOMOImports.swift**: Provides a single import point for all the types
- **TypesTest.swift**: Contains a view to test if all types are available
- **TypesTestEntry.swift**: Provides an entry point to add the TypesTestView to your app
- **AppIntegration.swift**: Shows how to integrate the TypesTestView into your app
- **update_imports.sh**: Script to update import statements in your project files

## Additional Notes

- The `FOMOTypes.swift` file contains all the type definitions needed for your app
- The `#if !SWIFT_PACKAGE` conditional compilation blocks ensure that the types are only defined when not using Swift Package Manager
- If you need to add more types, add them to `FOMOTypes.swift` following the same pattern
