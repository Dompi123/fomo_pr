# Fixing "No such module 'FOMO_PR'" Error

This guide provides specific steps to fix the "No such module 'FOMO_PR'" error in your Xcode project.

## Understanding the Issue

The error "No such module 'FOMO_PR'" occurs when Xcode can't find the FOMO_PR module. This typically happens when:

1. The module isn't properly defined in your Xcode project
2. There's a mismatch between your package structure and how Xcode is trying to access it
3. The build settings in Xcode aren't properly configured

## Step 1: Check Your Xcode Project Structure

Make sure your Xcode project is properly set up:

1. Open your Xcode project
2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), make sure the FOMO_PR target is selected
3. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
4. Search for "module"
5. Make sure "Defines Module" is set to "Yes"
6. Make sure "Product Module Name" is set to "FOMO_PR"

## Step 2: Update Your Import Statements

Instead of using module imports, use direct imports:

```swift
// Don't use this:
import FOMO_PR

// Instead, just import Foundation and SwiftUI:
import Foundation
import SwiftUI
```

## Step 3: Use the New Files

We've created several new files to help fix this issue:

1. **ModuleDefinition.swift**: Ensures the FOMO_PR module is properly defined
2. **FOMOApp.swift**: Provides a simple app entry point
3. **DirectImports.swift**: Directly imports all the types needed in your app

Make sure these files are included in your Xcode project:

1. In Xcode, go to File > Add Files to "FOMO_PR"...
2. Select the new files and make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
3. Click "Add"

## Step 4: Clean and Rebuild

Clean your build folder and rebuild the project:

1. In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder
2. Close Xcode completely
3. Reopen Xcode and your project
4. Build the project (Command+B)

## Step 5: Alternative Approach - Don't Use Module Imports

If you're still having issues, you can avoid module imports altogether:

1. Instead of importing FOMO_PR, just import Foundation and SwiftUI
2. Make sure all your type definitions are directly included in your Xcode project
3. Use the types directly without module qualifiers

## Step 6: Check for Framework vs. Library Issues

The error might be related to how your project is configured:

1. In Xcode, select your project in the Project Navigator
2. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
3. Search for "mach-o"
4. Make sure "Mach-O Type" is set to "Static Library" for the FOMO_PR target

## Step 7: Check for Circular Dependencies

Make sure there are no circular dependencies in your project:

1. Check if any of your files are trying to import FOMO_PR while also being part of the FOMO_PR module
2. If so, remove those imports or restructure your code
