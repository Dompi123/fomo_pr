# FINAL FIX GUIDE: Resolving All Build Issues

This guide provides a comprehensive solution to fix all the build issues in your Xcode project, particularly the issues with `Security` namespace, `TokenizationService`, and other type conflicts.

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is that your project has a complex module structure with conflicting type definitions across different targets:

1. The `Security` namespace and `TokenizationService` protocol are defined in multiple places
2. The Xcode build system is confused about which implementation to use
3. The Swift Package Manager build works because it uses a different build process with explicit exclusions

## Step 1: Add the New Files to Your Xcode Project

1. In Xcode, go to File > Add Files to "FOMO_PR"...
2. Navigate to and add these files (make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked):
   - `FOMO_PR/SecurityTypes.swift` (NEW - contains all Security and TokenizationService definitions)
   - `FOMO_PR/FOMO_PR.modulemap` (NEW - helps with module mapping)
   - `FOMO_PR/FOMO_PR-Bridging-Header.h`
   - `FOMO_PR/XcodeTypeHelper.swift` (UPDATED - no longer contains Security definitions)
   - `FOMO_PR/ModuleDefinition.swift`
   - `FOMO_PR/DirectImports.swift`

## Step 2: Update Your Xcode Project Settings

1. Select your project in the Project Navigator
2. Select the "FOMO_PR" target
3. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
4. Search for "bridging header"
5. Set "Objective-C Bridging Header" to `FOMO_PR/FOMO_PR-Bridging-Header.h`
6. Search for "module map"
7. Set "Module Map File" to `FOMO_PR/FOMO_PR.modulemap`
8. Search for "module"
9. Set "Defines Module" to "Yes"
10. Set "Product Module Name" to "FOMO_PR"

## Step 3: Remove Conflicting Files from Your Xcode Project

The key to fixing the build issues is to ensure there's only ONE definition of each type. Remove these files from your Xcode project (but don't delete them from disk):

1. Any files that define `Security` namespace
2. Any files that define `TokenizationService` protocol
3. Any files that define `LiveTokenizationService` or `MockTokenizationService` classes

Specifically, look for and remove:
- `Core/Payment/TokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Payment/Tokenization/TokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Payment/Tokenization/LiveTokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Payment/Tokenization/MockTokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Payment/LiveTokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Payment/MockTokenizationService.swift`
- `Core/Network/TokenizationService.swift`

## Step 4: Update Import Statements

In any files that use `Security` or `TokenizationService`, make sure they're importing the correct module:

```swift
// Change this:
import FOMO_PR.Security

// To this:
import FOMO_PR
```

Or even better, just use direct imports:

```swift
import Foundation
import SwiftUI
```

## Step 5: Clean and Rebuild

1. In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder
2. Close Xcode completely
3. Reopen Xcode and your project
4. Build the project (Command+B)

## Step 6: If You Still Have Issues

If you're still seeing errors:

1. **Check for duplicate type definitions**:
   - Use the Find in Project feature (Command+Shift+F) to search for "enum Security" or "protocol TokenizationService"
   - Make sure there's only ONE definition of each type

2. **Check for circular dependencies**:
   - Make sure no module is trying to import itself
   - Check if any module is importing another module that imports it back

3. **Last Resort: Create a New Target**:
   - Create a new target in your Xcode project
   - Add only the essential files needed for your app
   - Use direct imports instead of module imports

## Why This Works

This approach works because:

1. We've created a single source of truth for all the problematic types
2. We've removed all conflicting definitions
3. We've ensured proper module mapping
4. We've simplified the import structure

The Swift Package Manager build was already working because it was explicitly excluding the conflicting files. Now, your Xcode build will work too because we've removed the conflicts and provided clear type definitions.
