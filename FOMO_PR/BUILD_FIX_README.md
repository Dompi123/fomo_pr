# Build Fix Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to fix the build issues in your Xcode project.

## Steps to Fix Build Issues

1. **Update your import statements**:
   - In files that were previously importing from Models or Network modules, you should now import from FOMO_PR
   - For example, change `import Models` to `import FOMO_PR`
   - We've provided a script `update_imports.sh` that automatically updates these imports in your project files

2. **Add the TypesTestView to your app**:
   - Add the TypesTestView to your app's navigation or as a separate screen
   - This will help you verify that all the types are available
   - See `AppIntegration.swift` for examples of how to integrate the TypesTestView

3. **Build and run the app**:
   - Build and run the app to see if the issues are resolved
   - If you're still seeing errors, check the specific error messages and make sure the corresponding types are defined in `FOMOTypes.swift`

## Key Files

- **FOMOTypes.swift**: Contains all the type definitions needed for your app
- **FOMOImports.swift**: Provides a single import point for all the types
- **TypesTest.swift**: Contains a view to test if all types are available
- **TypesTestEntry.swift**: Provides an entry point to add the TypesTestView to your app
- **AppIntegration.swift**: Shows how to integrate the TypesTestView into your app

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing build errors after following these steps:

1. **Clean your build folder**: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder
2. **Check for specific error messages**: Look at the specific error messages and make sure the corresponding types are defined in `FOMOTypes.swift`
3. **Update your import statements**: Make sure all files that need types from Models, Network, or Core are now importing from FOMO_PR
4. **Check for conditional compilation**: Make sure any code that uses `#if SWIFT_PACKAGE` is properly handled

## Additional Notes

- The `FOMOTypes.swift` file contains all the type definitions needed for your app
- The `#if !SWIFT_PACKAGE` conditional compilation blocks ensure that the types are only defined when not using Swift Package Manager
- If you need to add more types, add them to `FOMOTypes.swift` following the same pattern
