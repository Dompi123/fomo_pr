# FOMO Design System: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for implementing, expanding, and integrating the FOMO design system across the application. The plan is structured into sequential phases with clear deliverables and milestones.

## Phase 1: Foundation Preparation (1-2 weeks)

### 1.1 Audit & Inventory
- [ ] Audit existing UI elements across all screens
- [ ] Document inconsistencies and pattern variations
- [ ] Catalog all UI patterns that need design system components
- [ ] Identify high-priority screens for initial migration

### 1.2 Bridge Implementation
- [x] Enhance the legacy adapter in `Core/FOMOTheme.swift`
- [x] Create utility functions to map between old and new systems
- [x] Add deprecation warnings to guide developers to new components
- [x] Establish pattern for component co-existence during transition

### 1.3 Integration Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up build validation for design system usage
- [x] Create documentation structure for the design system
- [x] Extend ThemeShowcaseView to allow component testing
- [ ] Add design system section in development environment

## Phase 2: Component Expansion (2-4 weeks)

### 2.1 Form Components
- [x] `FOMOTextField` - Text input with validation states
- [x] `FOMOToggle` - Toggle switch with styling
- [x] `FOMOCheckbox` - Checkbox with custom styling
- [x] `FOMOPicker` - Dropdown/selection component
- [ ] `FOMODatePicker` - Date selection component

### 2.2 Navigation Components
- [ ] `FOMOTabBar` - Consistent tab navigation
- [ ] `FOMONavigationBar` - App header with title and actions
- [ ] `FOMOListItem` - Standardized list items with variations
- [ ] `FOMOSearchBar` - Search with filter capabilities

### 2.3 Media Components
- [ ] `FOMOImage` - Image component with loading states
- [ ] `FOMOAvatar` - Profile and venue avatars
- [ ] `FOMOVideoPlayer` - Video player with custom controls
- [ ] `FOMOProgressView` - Loading and progress indicators

### 2.4 Specialized Components
- [ ] `FOMOVenueCard` - Venue display component
- [ ] `FOMOEventCard` - Event display component
- [ ] `FOMODrinkItem` - Drink menu item
- [ ] `FOMOTicketView` - Ticket/pass display

## Phase 3: Animation & Interaction System (1-2 weeks)

### 3.1 Animation Foundations
- [ ] Define standard durations and timing curves
- [ ] Create reusable animation modifiers
- [ ] Implement state transition animations
- [ ] Design loading state animations

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
- [ ] Standardize touch feedback across components
- [ ] Implement scroll animations and effects
- [ ] Create transition animations between screens
- [ ] Add micro-interactions for critical touchpoints

### 3.3 State Management
- [ ] Design empty state patterns
- [ ] Create error state presentations
- [ ] Implement skeleton loading screens
- [ ] Design success/confirmation states

## Phase 4: Integration & Migration (3-4 weeks)

### 4.1 Pilot Implementation
- [ ] Select 2-3 high-visibility screens for initial migration
- [ ] Refactor screens to use design system components
- [ ] Document migration process and patterns
- [ ] Gather feedback and refine components as needed

### 4.2 Migration Tooling
- [x] Create migration guide with examples
- [ ] Add lint rules to flag deprecated UI patterns
- [ ] Implement code suggestions/quick fixes for migration
- [ ] Create PR templates for design system migrations

### 4.3 Systematic Migration
- [ ] Establish timeline for full application migration
- [ ] Prioritize remaining screens by visibility/complexity
- [ ] Implement migration in batches of related screens
- [ ] Track migration progress with metrics

## Phase 5: Documentation & Governance (Ongoing)

### 5.1 Developer Documentation
- [x] Expand component API documentation
- [x] Create usage examples and code snippets
- [ ] Document common patterns and compositions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and best practices guides

### 5.2 Design System Guide
- [x] Enhance ThemeShowcaseView with interactive examples
- [ ] Create searchable component catalog
- [x] Add visual documentation for spacing, typography, etc.
- [x] Include do's and don'ts with examples

### 5.3 Governance & Maintenance
- [ ] Establish review process for design system changes
- [ ] Create feedback mechanism for improvement suggestions
- [ ] Set up monitoring for design system compliance
- [ ] Plan regular maintenance and update cycles
